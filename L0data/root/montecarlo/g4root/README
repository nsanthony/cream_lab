Installation notes
====================

To be able to compile and use g4root module one needs first to install GEANT4
version > 4.8.2 and CLHEP as required by GEANT4 installation (see 
http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/download.shtml and the Release Notes
on that page). Follow the GEANT4 installation procedure as described by G4
installation guide. Do 'gmake includes' at the end.

Add the following options to ROOT configure:
configure linux   --with-g4-incdir=$G4INSTALL/include \
                  --with-g4-libdir=$G4LIB/$G4SYSTEM \
                  --with-clhep-incdir=/usr/local/include
or simply:
                  --enable-g4root \
if the environment variables: $G4INSTALL, $G4LIB, $G4SYSTEM and $CLHEP_BASE_DIR
are set.
